Let’s compute the full attention score matrix for 3 students (A, B, C) from start → finish, step-by-step, with numbers and plain-language interpretation.

## Setup

Raw trait vectors (each student = 4 numbers):

- `X_A = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]`
- `X_B = [0.5, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2]`
- `X_C = [0.0, 0.3, 0.2, 0.6]`

Query glasses `W_Q` (4 → 2):

```js
W_Q = [
  [1, 0],
  [0, 1],
  [1, 1],
  [0, 3],
];
```

Key glasses `W_K` (4 → 2):

```js
W_K = [
  [1, 2],
  [0, 1],
  [2, 0],
  [1, 1],
];
```

(We are using 2-dimensional queries/keys here: `d_k = 2`.)

## Step 1 — Compute queries `Q = X @ W_Q` (one query vector per student)

Student A

- `Q_A = X_A @ W_Q`
- Aspect1 = `0.1*1 + 0.2*0 + 0.3*1 + 0.4*0 = 0.4`
- Aspect2 = `0.1*0 + 0.2*1 + 0.3*1 + 0.4*3 = 1.7`

  → `Q_A = [0.4, 1.7]`

Student B

- `Q_B = X_B @ W_Q`
- Aspect1 = `0.5*1 + 0.1*0 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*0 = 0.9`
- Aspect2 = `0.5*0 + 0.1*1 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*3 = 1.1`
  z
  → `Q_B = [0.9, 1.1]`

Student C

- `Q_C = X_C @ W_Q`
- Aspect1 = `0*1 + 0.3*0 + 0.2*1 + 0.6*0 = 0.2`
- Aspect2 = `0*0 + 0.3*1 + 0.2*1 + 0.6*3 = 2.3`

  → `Q_C = [0.2, 2.3]`

So the query matrix:

```js
Q = [
  [0.4, 1.7],
  [0.9, 1.1],
  [0.2, 2.3],
];
```

- A’s query = `[0.4, 1.7]` means A is mostly searching for good storytellers (second aspect is high).
- B’s query = `[0.9, 1.1]` means B wants a balance: someone decent at both math and storytelling.
- C’s query = `[0.2, 2.3]` means C really, really wants storytellers.

## Step 2 — Compute keys `K = X @ W_K` (one key vector per student)

Student A

- `K_A = X_A @ W_K`
- Aspect1 = `0.1*1 + 0.2*0 + 0.3*2 + 0.4*1 = 1.1`
- Aspect2 = `0.1*2 + 0.2*1 + 0.3*0 + 0.4*1 = 0.8`

  → `K_A = [1.1, 0.8]`

Student B

- `K_B = X_B @ W_K`
- Aspect1 = `0.5*1 + 0.1*0 + 0.4*2 + 0.2*1 = 1.5`
- Aspect2 = `0.5*2 + 0.1*1 + 0.4*0 + 0.2*1 = 1.3`

  → `K_B = [1.5, 1.3]`

Student C

- `K_C = X_C @ W_K`
- Aspect1 = `0*1 + 0.3*0 + 0.2*2 + 0.6*1 = 1.0`
- Aspect2 = `0*2 + 0.3*1 + 0.2*0 + 0.6*1 = 0.9`

  → `K_C = [1.0, 0.9]`

So the key matrix:

```js
K = [
  [1.1, 0.8],
  [1.5, 1.3],
  [1.0, 0.9],
];
```

Keys = how students “offer their help.”
E.g., Student B’s key `[1.5, 1.3]`:

- B is advertising: “I can help a lot with math, and also quite a bit with storytelling.”

Each axis/aspect is literally a direction in space.

Imagine a piece of paper:

- Horizontal axis = math skills.
- Vertical axis = storytelling skills.
- Each student’s query is a little arrow on this paper.

A’s arrow points mostly upward → “looking for storytellers.”
B’s arrow points diagonal → “looking for balanced skills.”
C’s arrow points steeply upward → “really looking for storytellers.”

### Why this matters in AI

In real transformers:

- The aspects are not fixed things like math/storytelling.
- They’re learned features that capture patterns in data.
  For example:
- One direction may mean “is this word about an animal?”
- Another may mean “is this word the subject of the sentence?”

So when I say “A is looking for traits in the second direction,” I mean:

- Student A’s query emphasizes one particular hidden feature more than the others.
- That hidden feature might correspond to something interpretable (like “subject-ness”) or something abstract we can’t easily name.

## Step 3 — Raw scores `S = Q @ K^T` (pairwise dot products)

Compute `s_ij = Q_i · K_j` (i = querying student, j = candidate student to attend to):

Row for A (Q_A = [0.4,1.7]):

- `s_AA = [0.4,1.7]·[1.1,0.8] = 0.4*1.1 + 1.7*0.8 = 0.44 + 1.36 = 1.80`
- `s_AB = [0.4,1.7]·[1.5,1.3] = 0.4*1.5 + 1.7*1.3 = 0.60 + 2.21 = 2.81`
- `s_AC = [0.4,1.7]·[1.0,0.9] = 0.4*1.0 + 1.7*0.9 = 0.40 + 1.53 = 1.93`

Row for B (Q_B = [0.9,1.1]):

- `s_BA = [0.9,1.1]·[1.1,0.8] = 0.99 + 0.88 = 1.87`
- `s_BB = [0.9,1.1]·[1.5,1.3] = 1.35 + 1.43 = 2.78`
- `s_BC = [0.9,1.1]·[1.0,0.9] = 0.90 + 0.99 = 1.89`

Row for C (Q_C = [0.2,2.3]):

- `s_CA = [0.2,2.3]·[1.1,0.8] = 0.22 + 1.84 = 2.06`
- `s_CB = [0.2,2.3]·[1.5,1.3] = 0.30 + 2.99 = 3.29`
- `s_CC = [0.2,2.3]·[1.0,0.9] = 0.20 + 2.07 = 2.27`

So the raw score matrix:

```js
S = [
  [1.8, 2.81, 1.93],
  [1.87, 2.78, 1.89],
  [2.06, 3.29, 2.27],
];
```

Plain meaning: e.g. `s_AB = 2.81` means A’s query matches B’s key strongly (A should probably pay attention to B).

## Step 4 — Scale the scores (/ sqrt(d_k))

`d_k = 2` → `sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41421356`. Divide each entry:

Scaled `S'` ≈ (rounded):

```css
S' ≈ [[1.2728, 1.9875, 1.3645],
      [1.3229, 1.9661, 1.3363],
      [1.4565, 2.3273, 1.6057]]
```

We had raw dot products like `2.81`, `1.80`, etc.
Those numbers can get very large if the query/key vectors are high-dimensional (say 512, 1024, etc. in real transformers).

Problem: Large values → when we apply softmax, it turns into something almost like a hard 0/1 choice (one very big probability, others near 0). This makes gradients very unstable and training harder.

Solution: Divide by `√(dₖ)`.

In our tiny case dₖ = 2, so we divide by √2 ≈ 1.41. It just normalizes the numbers to a nice range.

## Step 5 — Softmax row-wise → attention weights A (each row sums to 1)

Apply softmax to each row of S' (convert raw scores to positive weights that sum to 1):

### Why do we need softmax?

Softmax is a conversion from raw scores → probabilities.

#### The problem we want to solve

We have raw scores (like 1.27, 1.99, 1.36) that measure “compatibility.”
We want to turn them into weights with two properties:

1.  All weights ≥ 0 (so no negative “attention”).
2.  They sum to 1 (so they can be seen as probabilities/percentages of attention).

#### First naive attempt

“just divide each score by the sum.”

$$
w_i = \frac{s_i}{\sum_j s_j}
$$

Problem:

- If `s_i` is negative, weights can be negative.
- If `s_i = 0`, you lose that option completely.
- Doesn’t really highlight bigger scores strongly enough.

#### Trick: use exponentials

Exponential function $e^x$ has two magical properties:

Always positive (so we solve the “negative weights” issue).

Magnifies differences (e.g. between 2 and 3, $e^x=7.39, e^3 = 20.08$ -> the gap got bigger). So we say

$$
w_i = \frac{e^{s_i}}{\sum_j e^{s_j}}
$$

$$
\text{softmax}(s_i) = \frac{e^{s_i}}{\sum_j e^{s_j}}
$$

Row A (softmax of [1.2728, 1.9875, 1.3645]) → approx:

```css
A_rowA ≈ [0.2416, 0.4938, 0.2646]
```

Row B (softmax of [1.3229, 1.9661, 1.3363]) → approx:

```css
A_rowB ≈ [0.2553, 0.4859, 0.2588]
```

Row C (softmax of [1.4565, 2.3273, 1.6057]) → approx:

```css
A_rowC ≈ [0.2199, 0.5253, 0.2548]
```

So the attention weight matrix A (rounded) is:

```css
A ≈ [[0.2416, 0.4938, 0.2646],
     [0.2553, 0.4859, 0.2588],
     [0.2199, 0.5253, 0.2548]]
```

How to read a row: row i shows how token/student i distributes attention across A,B,C.

- Example: Row A ≈ `[0.24, 0.49, 0.26]` means A pays ~49% attention to B, ~24% to itself, ~26% to C.
- Row C pays ~52% to B, ~22% to A, ~25% to itself.

## Summary

- All three students give the largest single share of their attention to B (middle column). That means B’s key matches the others’ queries best — B is the most relevant/central in this tiny scenario.

## Step 6 — Compute Values `V = X @ W_V`

Just like Queries (Q) and Keys (K), we also project the raw traits `X` into Value space using a learnable matrix `W_V`.
We haven’t defined `W_V` yet, so let’s make one for our example (say 4 → 2, same shape as Q/K):

```js
W_V = [
  [1, 0],
  [0, 2],
  [1, 1],
  [2, 0],
];
```

Now compute values for each student:

Student A (X_A = `[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]`):

- `v1 = 0.1*1 + 0.2*0 + 0.3*1 + 0.4*2 = 0.1 + 0 + 0.3 + 0.8 = 1.2`
- `v2 = 0.1*0 + 0.2*2 + 0.3*1 + 0.4*0 = 0 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0 = 0.7`

  → `V_A = [1.2, 0.7]`

Student B (X_B = `[0.5,0.1,0.4,0.2]`):

- `v1 = 0.5*1 + 0.1*0 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*2 = 0.5 + 0 + 0.4 + 0.4 = 1.3`
- `v2 = 0.5*0 + 0.1*2 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*0 = 0 + 0.2 + 0.4 + 0 = 0.6`

  → `V_B = [1.3, 0.6]`

Student C (X_C = `[0.0,0.3,0.2,0.6]`):

- `v1 = 0*1 + 0.3*0 + 0.2*1 + 0.6*2 = 0 + 0 + 0.2 + 1.2 = 1.4`
- `v2 = 0*0 + 0.3*2 + 0.2*1 + 0.6*0 = 0 + 0.6 + 0.2 + 0 = 0.8`

  → `V_C = [1.4, 0.8]`

So the Value matrix is:

```js
V = [
  [1.2, 0.7], // A
  [1.3, 0.6], // B
  [1.4, 0.8], // C
];
```

The dot product `Q·K` tells us: “How relevant is person j’s info to person i’s needs?”

But that’s only a relevance score. It doesn’t give us the info itself.
We still need the actual content, which lives in the Value vectors.

Imagine the classroom story again:

- Each student listens to others with different levels of attention (weights).
- If A gives 50% attention to B, 25% to C, and 25% to itself → A’s new “knowledge” should be 50% B’s content + 25% C’s content + 25% its own content.

That’s literally what the weighted sum does

## Step 7 — Weighted sum: `Z = A @ V`

Now, each student’s new representation (Z) is a weighted sum of all the Value vectors, using their attention row as weights.

Formula:

$$
Z_i = \sum_j A_{ij} V_j
$$

It means student i’s new representation is a mixture of everyone else’s content, proportional to how much attention they gave.

Student A’s new vector:

Attention weights: [0.2416, 0.4938, 0.2646]

- z1 = 0.2416\*1.2 + 0.4938\*1.3 + 0.2646\*1.4
  = 0.2899 + 0.6419 + 0.3704 ≈ 1.3022

- z2 = 0.2416\*0.7 + 0.4938\*0.6 + 0.2646\*0.8
  = 0.1691 + 0.2963 + 0.2117 ≈ 0.6771

→ `Z_A ≈ [1.30, 0.68]`

Student B’s new vector:

Attention weights: [0.2553, 0.4859, 0.2588]

- z1 = 0.2553\*1.2 + 0.4859\*1.3 + 0.2588\*1.4
  = 0.3064 + 0.6317 + 0.3623 ≈ 1.3004

- z2 = 0.2553\*0.7 + 0.4859\*0.6 + 0.2588\*0.8
  = 0.1787 + 0.2915 + 0.2070 ≈ 0.6772

→ `Z_B ≈ [1.30, 0.68]`

Student C’s new vector:

Attention weights: [0.2199, 0.5253, 0.2548]

- z1 = 0.2199\*1.2 + 0.5253\*1.3 + 0.2548\*1.4
  = 0.2639 + 0.6830 + 0.3567 ≈ 1.3036

- z2 = 0.2199\*0.7 + 0.5253\*0.6 + 0.2548\*0.8
  = 0.1539 + 0.3152 + 0.2038 ≈ 0.6729

→ `Z_C ≈ [1.30, 0.67]`

## Final Result: Contextualized Student Representations

```js
Z ≈ [
  [1.30, 0.68],   // A’s updated info
  [1.30, 0.68],   // B’s updated info
  [1.30, 0.67],   // C’s updated info
];

```

For A:

- `Z_A ≈ [1.30, 0.68]` → mostly influenced by B (since A paid ~50% attention to B).

For all three:

- Everyone’s new representation ≈ `[1.30, 0.68]`.
- They all converged to B’s perspective because B was the most “central.”

### Before attention

A had its own backpack: `[1.2, 0.7]`.
(some examples, some explanations)

But that’s just A’s limited notes, only from A’s perspective.

### After attention → Z_A

A looks around:

- “B looks really relevant (≈50%).”
- “C is a bit relevant (≈25%).”
- “I’ll also keep some of my own notes (≈25%).”

So A mixes backpacks like this:

```js
Z_A = 0.24 * A’s notes + 0.49 * B’s notes + 0.26 * C’s notes
```

Z_A is A’s new backpack — updated notes that now include perspectives from others.

### Why this matters in AI

In language models:

- Word = student.
- Z_A = the word’s contextual meaning after listening to other words in the sentence.

## Example:

Sentence: “The cat sat.”

- “sat” listens mostly to “cat.”
- So Z_sat = its new meaning = “sat (done by a cat).”
- Without attention, “sat” could mean anything. With attention, it’s grounded in context.

## How real Transformers work:

In real Transformers, they always make sure the input and output of a layer have the same dimensionality (say, 512 or 768 or 1024).

- Step 1: You start with `X` (shape = n_tokens × d_model).
- Step 2: You project into Q, K, V spaces (usually same dimension `d_model`, though they can be split into multiple “heads”).
- Step 3: After attention, you get `Z` (shape = n_tokens × d_model).

Because `d_model` is the same everywhere, you can directly feed Z into the next layer as the new X.

## Layer-by-Layer Story: Backpack Borrowing

### Layer 1 — First Round of Sharing

- Each student (word) starts with their own backpack (their raw traits).
- They look around using Queries & Keys → decide who to borrow from.
- Then they update their backpack (Z) with weighted mixtures of Values.

After Layer 1, each student has:

- Not just their own notes,
- But also a blend of neighbors’ notes.

In our example:
A, B, and C all end up with very similar backpacks `[1.30, 0.68]` because they all leaned heavily on B.

So now, everyone has a shared “baseline knowledge” centered around B.

### Layer 2 — Second Round of Sharing

Now, imagine the process repeats:

- Students again compute Queries, Keys, and Values, but this time from their new backpacks (Z) instead of the raw X.
- They look around again, maybe noticing new patterns.

Analogy:

- In round 1, everyone borrowed B’s storytelling notes.
- Now in round 2, since everyone has some storytelling ability, maybe the Queries/Keys will shift focus to a different trait (like math skills).

- So in Layer 2, attention might redistribute:
  - Maybe now A pays more attention to C,
  - Or B finds A newly relevant.

Backpacks evolve again: they are not fixed.
Each round makes them richer, more contextual.

### Layer 3 — Deeper Context

With more layers:

- Early layers often capture basic relationships (“who is near me in the sentence?”).
- Middle layers capture syntactic roles (“who is the subject, object, verb?”).
- Deeper layers capture semantic meaning (“the cat = furry animal, sitting action = cat is the doer”).

In the classroom:

- Round 1: “Who has the loudest notes?” (everyone copies B).
- Round 2: “Now that I have B’s notes, who else can I learn from?”
- Round 3: “I’ve gathered knowledge from everyone — now I can form deeper insights.”

## Transformer Intuition

- By the final layer, every student (word) has a backpack that reflects the whole classroom’s knowledge, contextualized to its role.

That’s why in GPT, the final representation of “cat” in “The cat sat on the mat” knows:

- It’s a noun.
- It’s the subject of “sat.”
- It refers to a furry animal.
- It’s distinct from “mat,” which is the object.

All of this comes from layer after layer of sharing and refining.
