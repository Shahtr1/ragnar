Let’s drop a real [CLS] student into your exact numeric example and follow it start → finish, showing exactly where CLS sits, what it computes, and what it does at the end.

I’ll keep your original students A, B, C and prepend a CLS token (this is how models like BERT do it: `[CLS], A, B, C`).

I’ll use a simple, small learned initial CLS vector for illustration:

- `X_CLS = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]` (think: a learned “placeholder” starting backpack)

Using the same projection matrices you gave (`W_Q`, `W_K`, `W_V`), we get:

1. CLS’s own projections (Query / Key / Value)

Compute `Q_CLS = X_CLS @ W_Q`, `K_CLS = X_CLS @ W_K`, `V_CLS = X_CLS @ W_V`.

- `Q_CLS = [0.4, 1.0]`
- `K_CLS = [0.8, 0.8]`
- `V_CLS = [0.8, 0.60]`

So now our matrices (order: CLS, A, B, C) are:

```js
Q = [[0.4, 1.0],   # CLS
     [0.4, 1.7],   # A
     [0.9, 1.1],   # B
     [0.2, 2.3]]   # C

K = [[0.8, 0.8],   # CLS
     [1.1, 0.8],   # A
     [1.5, 1.3],   # B
     [1.0, 0.9]]   # C

V = [[0.8, 0.6],   # CLS
     [1.2, 0.7],   # A
     [1.3, 0.6],   # B
     [1.4, 0.8]]   # C

```

2. Raw pairwise scores S = Q @ K^T (including CLS)

This produces a 4×4 score matrix (rows = who is querying, cols = who is offering):

```css
S ≈
[[1.12, 1.24, 1.90, 1.30],   # CLS · {CLS, A, B, C}
 [1.68, 1.80, 2.81, 1.93],   # A
 [1.60, 1.87, 2.78, 1.89],   # B
 [2.00, 2.06, 3.29, 2.27]]   # C
```

3. Scale and softmax → attention weights A (row-wise)

Scale by `√d_k = √2 ≈ 1.414`, then softmax each row to get attention distributions:

Row-wise softmax (rounded):

```css
A ≈
[[0.2016, 0.2195, 0.3500, 0.2290],   # CLS’s attention distribution
 [0.1816, 0.1977, 0.4039, 0.2168],   # A
 [0.1742, 0.2108, 0.4012, 0.2138],   # B
 [0.1741, 0.1817, 0.4335, 0.2107]]   # C

```

Key things to read off:

- CLS row (first row) ≈ `[0.20, 0.22, 0.35, 0.23]`.
  → The CLS student listened most to B (~35%), then C (~23%), then A (~22%), and some to itself (~20%).
- All three original students still put the largest share on B — B remains central.

4. Weighted sum → updated representations `Z = A @ V`

Each token’s new vector is a weighted sum of all values (including CLS’s value). The resulting 4 updated rows (CLS, A, B, C):

```css
Z ≈
[ [1.2001, 0.6677],   # CLS  (final CLS embedding)
  [1.2111, 0.6631],   # A
  [1.2132, 0.6638],   # B
  [1.2159, 0.6603] ]  # C

```

### Why we use CLS:

- During pretraining (e.g., BERT) the network learns how to make CLS a good summarizer: the CLS initial vector parameters and the projection matrices are trained so that `CLS_final` becomes useful for downstream tasks.
- Practically: when you need one fixed-size vector for the whole sentence (like for classification), you can just take `CLS_final`. You don’t need to average or pick any other pooling.
- During the discussion, CLS is not special in the math — it computes queries/keys/values and attends — but the model is trained so that CLS’s final notes are the best place to read a summary from.
