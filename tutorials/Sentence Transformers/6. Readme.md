Let’s stay inside our classroom analogy (students A, B, C) and walk through Mean, CLS, and Max Pooling again, now tied to the sentiment example (“The movie was boring but the visuals were stunning”).

## Step 1. Students (Tokens)

- Each student = a token (word).
- Each backpack = a vector of traits: `[Positivity, Negativity]`.

Let’s assign:

| Student (Token) | Backpack (Vector) \[Pos, Neg] |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A = “boring”    | \[0.0, 0.9]                   |
| B = “visuals”   | \[0.3, 0.0]                   |
| C = “stunning”  | \[0.9, 0.0]                   |

(We skip “movie” since it doesn’t add much sentiment.)

## Step 2. Pooling Strategies

1. Mean Pooling (Average Students’ Knowledge)

Everyone empties their backpacks onto the desk.

We average traits: `[0.4, 0.3]`

Class knowledge: _“slightly more positive than negative”_ → Neutral / Mixed sentiment.

2. CLS Pooling (Elect a Class Rep)

- We add a special CLS student before class starts.
- CLS listens to A, B, and C during discussion and writes their own summary notes.
- From training, CLS might learn: “In reviews, strong positives like ‘stunning’ usually outweigh negatives like ‘boring.’”

So CLS’s final backpack might be: `[0.8 0.3]`

Class rep’s summary: “mostly positive, but some negativity” → Positive sentiment.

3. Max Pooling (Pick the Strongest Trait)

For each subject, pick whichever student is best at it:

Positivity = max([0.0, 0.3, 0.9]) = 0.9

Negativity = max([0.9, 0.0, 0.0]) = 0.9

So:`[0.9, 0.9]`

Class knowledge: “we have strong positivity AND strong negativity.”

This looks like a polarized / contradictory sentiment.
